This repo consist of a modified version of the PRESTO pipeline developed by Crist√≥bal Braga. Here you will find the necessary changes from the base installation in order to process ARTE logfiles and find FRB candidates. You may need to change some things like paths or different parameters used for ARTE; these files are such that you can just type the command you want and it will run with ARTE's default parameters The full_pipeline_doc.txt file will serve as a general guide to install, set up and use PRESTO and all it's requierements (go, singularity, etc).
If you have any questions please contact me.
